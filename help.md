## What is this?

A game based on the old gamespy game y.a.r.n.
The bot provides the first line of a story and players make suggestions how the story should be continued. The suggestions with the most votes from players are included in the story.

## How does it work?

Thumbs up story suggestions that you like in the yarn-game channel.
The most highly voted suggestion in a round gets included into the story.
*Votes for your own suggestions will not be counted*, and you may only make one suggestion of your own per round.
Each round lasts until suggestions have been made from 3 different authors + 10 minutes.
The game will last 10 rounds.
When a round is over, a new line is added to the story and users can submit suggestions to continue the story.
The winner is the person whose suggestions are used most often to complete the story.
There will be prizes if people engage with the game.

## How do I play?

Just DM the YarnBot with your suggestions for the next part of the story and thumbs up other people's suggestions that you like in the yarn-game channel (all other emotes are ignored).
